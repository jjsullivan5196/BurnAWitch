had not time for a nice manual, so I do it fast:

get the whole stuff from groundwork.h into your groundwork.h, overwrite:
level class
copy the functions from the groundwork.cpp into a cpp of yours.
make function header in the groundwork.h at the top after the includes.

get the vertex and pixelshader VSlevel and vspixel into your shaderfile.

in pvertices of the levelclass are ALL triangles.
Its rendering now ONE object (the whole level) at once. superfast.
But you would have to get your textures into one texture file!

How:

Photoshop and make one big image:

tex 1 | tex 2 | tex 3
____________________

tex 4 | tex 5 | tex 6
____________________

tex 7 | tex 8 | tex 9

this is one image that should include all 9 possible wall images.

Have fun.
